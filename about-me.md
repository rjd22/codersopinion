Hey, I’m Robert-Jan de Dreu. A programmer mostly focusing on the web. While using PHP and MVC I will make sure the program I’m building is well documented and structured. I use this blog to show what I made and keep reminding myself of little tasks that I have done and maybe need to do again.

I live in Utrecht, The Netherlands and can be found in Affiliate4you where my job is at. I’m available for freelancing if you want me to do a project for you. Just send me a message.
